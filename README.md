# Belcot
Instant Messaging Client similar to Facebook Messenger  
I originated the word Belcot from the polish word Bełkot meanning babble or mumble.  

### Launching
#### Server-side (Terminal-SERVER)
``` cd exec && java pl.belcot.Server 6669 ```  
**6669** is a typical **IM** port. Use any one you like.
#### Client-side (Terminal-CLIENT)
``` cd exec && java pl.belcot.Belcot ```  
Copy IP Address from *Terminal-SERVER*. Pass any nickname you like.
